Nowadays power converters are gaining more and more importance due to the increasing demand of energy efficient solutions in industrial applications, renewable energy sources and electrical transportation. To meet this new demand, development cycles must be shortened, without compromising the quality of the control software. This goal can be achieved with model driven development, and it also can make the process more agile. In the presented method, we are using MATLAB Simulink to implement the control related software components. These software modules, such as control loops and state machines can be functionally tested in the Simulink environment, with much better observability than the real embedded software. The embedded code is generated from these models. The embedded code only contains the framework, which is providing a interface between the model and the control peripherals and the real time operating system. In this paper we are discussing the process in detail on a frequency converter firmware as example.

\section{Introduction}
A modern VFD system must comply to many customer requiroments. There are also many industrial standard such as power factor regulations and EMC limitations wich are needed to control by software. The computation power of the embeddedd microcontrollers are capeble to achive this kind of sophistication, but the this power needed to be utilized by the programmer efficiently. The development cycles also getting shorter and shorter to met the constantly changing market demand. Therfore a modular, reusable and scalable control software need to be implemented.

One of the ways of this new way of thinking about software development is model-driven or model-based development. This means we are using graphical diagrams to describe the desired functionality instead of lines of program code. In power electronics this kind of abstraction can seem contradictionary, becouse  of the strict timing constraints, but as this paper will show, with the correct methodes high level problem solving and low level IO handling can go hand in hand. There are even many benefits of model-based desing due to the implemented control loops and state machines, wich can be easily viusalised and simulated with the proper software tool.

Modern software tools such as MATLAB and Simulink are very well suited to this task. The Embedded Coder toolbox generates the C code, wich can be complied in the embedded processor. Becouse the model is developped in Simulink, the behaviour of the implelemnted control algorythms can be tested immediatly, on the PC. When the simulations sows the desired results, the C code can be generated. This generated C code is 

In the II. chapter we are going to discuss the embedded framework, wich provides the connection between the Simulink model and the real microcontroller outputs and inputs. The III. chapter will present a short insight in the Simulink model, and present the challanges you can face during the development. The IV. chapter will provide a case study about the whole method. The example will be a IGBT thermal model. We will compare the simulated data and the measured tempereatures.


\section{Embedded Framework}

The embedded framework provides connection between the generated code and the hardware peripherials. All the hardware dependent code is written in native C language. The scheduling of the generated code is made by an embedded operation system and hardware interrupts (timers, analog-digital converters, etc.). In this case all the generated code is hardware independent and reusable. The model connects to the embedded code thrugh interfaces. These interfaces are represented as Buses in Simulink and structs in C. The input structs contain the parameters and the and the measured inputs, the output interfaces give signals for the embedded operation framework (start stop signals etc.) and give the calculated duty cycles and the switching frequency. 
On every PWM timer cycle timer interrupt is given. The timer pheripherial gives a signal to AD converters a new set of measurements available (Three phase currents and the DC voltage). The values which change slower then the switching period are measured in the main task. The measured AD values calculated to values in SI units. The outputs of the model are also in normalized number. In this case the connection between the embedded code and the model is also platform independent. Example the structure of the measured input values:

\begin{lstlisting}
typedef struct \{ \\
  real32_T VxMeasured; \\
  real32_T VyMeasured; \\
  real32_T Vdc; \\
  real32_T Ia; \\
  real32_T Ib; \\
  real32_T Ic; \\
  real32_T Ta; \\
  real32_T Tb; \\
  real32_T Tc; \\
  real32_T Tinner; \\
  real32_T Tbrake; \\
  real32_T V5Sto1Meas; \\
  real32_T V5Sto2Meas; \\
  real32_T V15Meas; \\
  real32_T FANSpeed1; \\
  real32_T FANSpeed2; \\
\} MeasurementIn;

\end{lstlisting}

All the measured inputs are 32 bit floating point numbers, the values start with V are voltages the values start with I are currents and the values start with T are temperatures.

\subsection{Scheduling the tasks}
For scheduling an embedded operation system is used. In this particular project the Keil RTX operation system is used. This Keil RTX has all the necessary tools for this project task priority levels timer functions and os signals. As it was mentioned above the PWM timer schedules the measurement of the DC voltage and the phase currents. After the measurements completed and the values calculated to their normalized values the motor control fast task is called. This task calculates the pwm duty cycle from the input and the given setpoint and checks whether the measured values exceed the predefined limits. 
There is a lower priority task which scheduled by the os timer. This task provides operation framework and the compute intensive functions are also placed there. The structure of the Simulink model is described on the following chapter.



\section{Simulink Model}
To be able to make offline measurements ans simulations the whole system is modeled with the excitations the inverter and the plant. Therefore the offline simulations can be done in Matlab Simulink enviroment and results can be compared to real life measurements. Testing is also important part of this model based developement. Thatswhy unit test enviroment built for every functional part of the of the inverter. To be able to test every part separeted, test enviroments has been made for them. These functions has the same input and output ports like the main model and the functionality models connect eachother through them. 
To be able to connect the the embedded code easily to the model common interfaces used. These common interfaces are represented as buses in Simulink. All modules have the following input-buses parameters, input
In Simulink the test excitations are given through these inputs and a behaviour is monitored through the outputs of these subsystem.  On the following chapters a case study is described about the IGBT thermal model.

\section{Case Study: IGBT Thermal model}

\subsection{The function of the Thermal model}
The semiconductor switches maximum allowable temperature is limited. The absolute maximum junction temperature of silicium based devices  are $175\ \degree{}C$ degrees. It is advisable to take the advantage of this temperature to keep the volume/power ratio as low as possible. The thermometer placed in the heat sink or in the semiconductor case does not provide suefficient information about the actual junction temperature of the semiconductor elements. However semiconductor junction temperatures can be calculated knowing the thermal model between the thermometer and the semiconductor junction. The model parameters and the model type are described in the datasheets. The junction temperatures can be calculated from the diode and transistor losses.

\subsection{The offline model}
The IGBT junction temperature calculation module structure is based on the principles laid down the full model description. The thermal model calculates the three phase bridge and the brake IGBT temperatures. The calculation method can be generalized, it is the same in every phase legs. The brake transistor is basically a truncated phase containing only the bottom transistors and freewheeling diode. With the following assumptions the temperute calculation can be simplified to only one transistor loss calculation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The inductance of the brake resistor is neglectable, therfore the current carried by the diode can be also neglected
    \item The switching loss of the diode can be also neglected, becouse the high power is carried by the IGBTs
    \item With the two assumptions above, we can also use the PWM controls signals directly in the loss calculation.
\end{itemize}

Due to the above considerations phase IGBT temperature and brake IGBT temperature library blocks created as building block elements. The library block interface is containing the input signals, the output signals and the parameter bus as discussed in the model description part.
The input bus is containing the current, the DC voltage and the duty cycle of the respective phase, switching frequency, case temperature. The parameter bus is containing the IGBT and the diode electrical and thermal parameters. The output bus is containing the IGBT and diode losses and temperatures. The parameters are calculated with a MATLAB script which contains the values from the datasheet and values derived from these parameters.

The library blocks can be separeted to three main parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duty cycle calculation of the individual semiconductor (diode, IGBT) elements
    \item Switching and conduction loss calculations for each element.
    \item Temperature calculation from power losses using a three tie constant thermal model (Foster network or PI). 
\end{itemize}
Duty cycle calculation of the individual semiconductor (diode, IGBT) elements
Switching and conduction loss calculations for each element.
Temperature calculation from power losses using a three tie constant thermal model (Foster network or PI). 

The three phase half-bridge IGBTs and brake IGBT temperature calculation is integrated in the model. This model can be easily simulated in the test environment and in the integrated model as a referenced model.

\subsection{Offline test evironment}

The test harness structure is the following: on the left side are the parameters and excitations. These blocks connected with the thermal model placed in the middle with the buses used in the integrated model. Output is on the right side. A model block created to calcalutethe one period average values of the output. The average values used for comparison with Semisel calculator.

In the Simulink model a defined setpoint can be set. The simulink model source parameters calculated with script. (Input parameters: DC voltage, phase current, $cos\phi{}$, switching frequency, Power Frequency, heat sink temperature). The Simulink model generates the excitation signals during the simulation.

The Semisel calculator program is used for validating the junction temperature calculator. The Semisel calculates the average temperature and the maximum temperature values of the selected device. Setting the same setpoint in the calculator program and in the simulation we expect the same result. The  semisel calculator doesn’t give information about the temperature vs time function, only shows the maximum temperatures. Because the junction temperatures are used for absolute temperature protections, comparing the simulated and calculated maximum temperature values is satisfactory. The temperature should differ the direction of safety so the temperature values are considered to be acceptable if the difference of the simulated and calculated temperatures is in the 0.. +5 range.
After the successful offline simulation, C code is generated from the integrated model which was tested in the real inverter.
The case, junction temperatures, phase currents was recorded in different setpoints on a drive testbench. The temperature vs. time function was simulated in Sumilink, then the simulated and measured junction temperatures were  plotted in a coordinate system, which was synchronized with the corresponding phase currents. The results can be seen in the figure.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
