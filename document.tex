Nowadays power converters are gaining more and more importance due to the increasing demand of energy efficient solutions in industrial applications, renewable energy sources and electrical transportation. To meet this new demand, development cycles must be shortened, without compromising the quality of the control software. This goal can be achieved with model driven development, and it also can make the process more agile. In the presented method, we are using MATLAB Simulink to implement the control related software components. These software modules, such as control loops and state machines can be functionally tested in the Simulink environment, with much better observability than the real embedded software. The embedded code is generated from these models. The embedded code additionally contains the framework, which is providing a interface between the model and the control peripherals and the real time operating system. In this paper we are discussing the process in detail on a frequency converter firmware as example.

\section{Introduction}
A modern VFD\footnote{Variable Frequency Drive} system must comply to many customer requiroments. There are also many industrial standard and directives wich are needed to control by software. The computation power of the embedded microcontrollers are capable to achieve this kind of sophistication, but this power needed to be utilized by the programmer efficiently. The development cycles also getting shorter and shorter to meet the constantly changing market demand. Therefore a modular, reusable and scalable control software need to be implemented.

\end{figure}

One of the ways of this new way of thinking about software development is model-driven or model-based development. This means we are using graphical diagrams to describe the desired functionality instead of lines of program code. In power electronics this kind of abstraction can seem contradictory, because  of the strict timing constraints, but as this paper will show, with the correct methods high level problem solving and low level IO handling can go hand in hand. There are even many benefits of model-based design due to the implemented control loops and state machines, which can be easily visualised and simulated with the proper software tool.

Modern software tools such as MATLAB and Simulink are very well suited to this task. The Embedded Coder toolbox generates the C code, which can be complied for the embedded processor. Because the model is developed in Simulink, the behavior of the implelemented control algorithms can be tested immediately, on the PC. After the off-line simulation shows the desired results, the C code can be generated. This generated C code is modular, reusable and platform independent. Due to this platform independent nature, a framework needs to be created. This framework provides the connection between the model and the peripherals, runs the necessary data management tasks and it is also responsible for the timing constraints.

In Chapter II. we are going to discuss the embedded framework, wich provides the connection between the Simulink model and the real microcontroller outputs and inputs. Chapter III. will present a short insight in the Simulink model, and present the challenges you can face during the development. Chapter IV. will provide a case study about the whole method. The example will be an IGBT thermal model. We will compare the simulated data and the measured temperatures.


\section{Embedded Framework}

The embedded framework provides connection between the generated code and the hardware peripherals. All the hardware dependent code is written in native C language. The scheduling of the generated code is made by an embedded operation system and hardware interrupts (timers, analog-digital converters, etc.). In this case, all the generated code compiled from Matlab is hardware independent and reusable. The model connects to the embedded code through interfaces. These interfaces are represented as Buses in Simulink and as structures in C. The input structures contain the parameters and the and the measured inputs, the output interfaces give signals for the embedded operation framework (start and stop signals etc.) and give the calculated duty cycles and the switching frequency. 
On every PWM timer cycle, a timer interrupt is given. The timer pheripheral gives a signal to the AD converters to have a new set of measurements available (Three phase currents and the DC voltage). The values which change slower than the switching period are measured in the main task. The measured AD values calculated to values in SI units. The outputs of the model are also in normalized number formats. In this case, the connection between the embedded code and the model is also platform independent. Example the structure of the measured input values:

\begin{absolutelynopagebreak}
\begin{lstlisting}
typedef struct { 
  real32_T VxMeasured; 
  real32_T VyMeasured; 
  real32_T Vdc; 
  real32_T Ia; 
  real32_T Ib; 
  real32_T Ic; 
  real32_T Ta; 
  real32_T Tb; 
  real32_T Tc; 
  real32_T Tinner; 
  real32_T Tbrake; 
  real32_T V5Sto1Meas; 
  real32_T V5Sto2Meas; 
  real32_T V15Meas; 
  real32_T FANSpeed1; 
  real32_T FANSpeed2; 
} MeasurementIn;

\end{lstlisting}
\end{absolutelynopagebreak}

All the measured inputs are 32 bit floating point numbers, the values start with V are voltages the values start with I are currents and the values start with T are temperatures.

\subsection{Scheduling the tasks}
For scheduling an embedded operation system is used. In this particular project the Keil RTX operation system (RTOS) is used. This Keil RTX has all the necessary tools for this project task priority levels timer functions and RTOS signals. As it was mentioned above, the PWM timer schedules the measurement of the DC voltage and the phase currents. After the measurements completed and the values calculated to their SI and normalized values the motor control fast task is called. This task calculates the PWM duty cycle from the input and the given set-point, and checks whether the measured values exceed the predefined limits. 
There is a lower priority task which scheduled by the RTOS timer. This task provides operation framework and the compute intensive functions are also placed there. The structure of the Simulink model is described on the following chapter.



\section{Simulink Model}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/inputs}

\caption{Simulink bus creator for MeasurementIn bus}
\label{fig:fig_MeasurementIn}
\end{figure}

To be able to make investigations with offline simulations the whole system is completed with the excitations, the inverter and the plant. Therefore the offline simulations can be done in Matlab Simulink environment and the results can be compared to real life measurements. To be able to connect the embedded code to the model easily, common interfaces are used. These common interfaces are represented as buses in Simulink. All modules have an input-bus containing parameters and input variables, as well as an output bus, where the calculated control signals are given. The difference between the input variables and parameters is that the inputs are measured values and excitations, while the parameters are the constants which are specific to the system. The Simulink representation of the MeasurementIn bus which was described in the last chapter is on the \ref{fig:fig_MeasurementIn} figure.

Testing is also important part of this model based developement. That's why unit test environment built for every functional part of the inverter software. To be able to test every part separated, test environments has been made for them. The functions connected to each other are modeled with Simulink Referenced Models, which is shown on Figure \ref{fig:ref_model}. The organizing principle of the grouping of these referenced models is the model frequency. As it was mentioned in the Embedded framework chapter there are two priority levels, the task which runs at switching period (e.g. at $500\ \mu{}s$, and one which scheduled by Keil RTX embedded operation system. The following chapter is a case study, where the referenced model is an IGBT thermal model. This IGBT thermal model is scheduled by the embedded operating system.

\section{Case Study: IGBT Thermal model}

\subsection{The function of the Thermal model}
The semiconductor switches maximum allowable temperature is limited. The absolute maximum junction temperature of silicon based devices  are $175\ \degree{}C$. It is advisable to take the advantage of this temperature to keep the volume/power ratio as low as possible. The thermometer placed in the heat sink or in the semiconductor's case does not provide sufficient information about the actual junction temperature of the semiconductor elements. However, the semiconductor's junction temperature can be estimated knowing the power loss of the semiconductor and the thermal model between the thermometer and the semiconductor junction. The model parameters and the model type are described in the datasheets. The junction temperatures can be calculated from the diode and transistor losses.

\subsection{The offline model}
The structure of the IGBT junction temperature calculation module is based on the principles laid down in the full model description. The thermal model calculates the three phase bridge and the brake IGBT temperatures. The calculation method can be generalized, it is the same in every phase legs. The brake transistor is basically a truncated phase leg containing only the bottom transistor and the upper freewheeling diode. With the following assumptions the temperature calculation can be simplified to only one transistor's loss calculation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The inductance of the brake resistor is negligible, therfore the current carried by the diode can be also neglected
    \item The switching loss of the diode can be also neglected, because the high power is carried by the IGBTs
    \item With the two assumptions above, we can also use the PWM controls signals directly in the loss calculation.
\end{itemize}

Due to the above considerations phase IGBT temperature and brake IGBT temperature library blocks created as building block elements. The library block interface is containing the input signals, the output signals and the parameter bus as discussed in the model description part.
The input variable bus contains the current, the DC voltage, and the duty cycle of the respective phase, the switching frequency and the case temperature. The parameter bus contains the IGBT and the diode electrical and thermal parameters. The output bus is containing the IGBT and diode losses and temperatures. The parameters are calculated with a MATLAB script which contains the values from the datasheet and values derived from these parameters.

The library blocks can be separated to three main parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duty cycle calculation of the individual semiconductor (diode, IGBT) elements
    \item Switching and conduction loss calculations for each element.
    \item Temperature calculation from power losses using a three tie constant thermal model (Foster network or PI). 
\end{itemize}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
\caption{The Foster thermal model}
\label{fig:foster}
\end{figure}

The temperature calculation of the three phase half-bridge IGBT's and brake IGBT's is integrated in the model. This model can be easily simulated in the test environment and in the integrated model as a referenced model.

\subsection{Offline test environment}

The test harness structure is the following: on the left side are the parameters and excitations. These blocks connected with the thermal model placed in the middle with the buses used in the integrated model. Output is on the right side. A model block is created to calculate one period average values of the output. The average values used for comparison with SemiSel calculator. SemiSel is a simulation tool from SEMIKRON for calculating power loss and temperature of power electronic components.

We can define the desired set-point in the simulation environment. The Simulink model's source parameters are calculated with script. (Input parameters: DC bus voltage, phase current, $cos\phi{}$, switching frequency, heat sink temperature). The Simulink model generates the excitation signals during the simulation.

The SemiSel calculator program is used for validating the calculated junction temperature. The SemiSel software calculates the average temperature and the maximum temperature values of the selected device. Setting the same set-point in the calculator program and in the simulation we expect the same result. The  SemiSel calculator does not give information about the temperature vs time function, only shows the maximum temperatures. Because the junction temperatures are used for absolute temperature protections, comparing the simulated and calculated maximum temperature values fulfills our reuqirements. The temperature should differ the onl in direction of safety, so the estimated temperatures should be higher, than the actual junction temperature. The temperature values are considered to be acceptable if the difference of the simulated and calculated temperatures is less than $5\ \degree{}C$ .

After the successful offline simulation, when we had seen the desired results, the C code was generated from the integrated model and was tested in the real inverter.

The case, junction temperatures and phase currents were recorded whit different set-points on a drive test-bench. The temperature vs. time function was simulated in Simulink, then the simulated and measured junction temperatures were  plotted in a coordinate system, which was synchronized with the corresponding phase currents. The results can be seen in the Figure \ref{fig:fig_sim}.
